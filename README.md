the chat1.py and chat2.py contains code for training with rasa nlu and dialgoues with rasa core.


Rasa is an open source framework we are using here.


We used Google Maps Api for calculating distance between the user and the hospitals nearby and using this data to suggest which hospital to consult based on the services they provide and the medical condition of the user.
It is in the folder googlemaps.
hezyra web has the html page for web service we plan to do




The major stuff we do using rasa are in rasa_stuff folder


The end product is a hospital traffic monitoring system using web service and a chatbot interface and google maps api is used to get location of all nearby hospitals.
